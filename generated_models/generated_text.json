The novel's most important insight is that our existence is not just a byproduct of our existence, as it is perceived by others.\n\nAs we know, society is about constructing a collective reality, and one's existence, or the existence of someone else, also affects and can affect one's reality in a variety of ways.\n  \nIn fact, in \"The God Delusion\" Richard Dawkins talks about how our ideas about existence have changed with our increasing ability of understanding the world, but our ideas have changed very little about the nature of existence.\n  \nIn short, reality is not independent of existence and is rather dependent on it.\n  \nIn a society of people striving to understand reality, and understanding the world, as described by the writer himself, and by his most important literary characters, \"Frankenstein\" is a perfect example of \"Theory\" at its best.\n  \nThere are numerous references to the fact that man is a \"species\" of animal, with biological needs that are not of our own making, and which we must fulfill in order to exist.\n  \nSome other references of interest: \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\"The God Delusion\" is, in a sense, a sort of \"scientific\" view of existence that argues that while we might not be exactly what the world has to offer, we still have the ability to understand reality. While this is quite an important claim, it is also important to remember that if the world offered such rich and varied experience, we would understand it in a different way \u2013 and we would be better able to deal with it. \n  \nThe fact of the matter is, most of us still accept reality and life in this simplistic way \u2013 as a by-product of our own existence and a reflection of our own experience, and this, for example, includes how \"love\" is perceived by us. \n  \nThe author of this article, I would say, is very wrong in saying that the novel is largely responsible for social and political unrest.  \nThe book is not simply a commentary on politics and society, a view expressed in various ways by various writers \u2013 the world does not operate independently of the author.\n  \nIn fact, many of the references that lead to the novel, and its most prominent character, are completely at odds with the views and values of the Victorian era. \n  \nWe can see this in the novel's perspective of gender roles, which are based on the traditional view of how the world operates and how society works. \nThe novel is very explicitly about what it means to be a woman, and it is about the nature of human existence, it is about the nature of human consciousness and about the meaning and purpose of humanity.\n  \nIt is also directly about social and political unrest. \nThe novel is not at all about modernism's view of society and the world.\nIt is not at all about the view that humanity is on an upward path, and that as it is \"the product of evolution\".\nIt is not about modern \"science\", which is \"futuristic\". \nThe novel is about the reality of human existence, and about the value that it has, or once had, and the value that we still have, even though we might not have realized it. \n  \nAs long as the culture we live in continues to operate in the same way that it has for much of history, we will continue to experience the world in a different way.  \n  \n(Note: there is a very important element to the novel that was overlooked by most authors, but that it did not escape some authors, and that is that even though the world and society is very complex, and it is quite", "temperature": 0.9}, {"og_text": "Report on Frankenstein:\n    When reviewing the cultural inpact of Frankenstein it is clear that \n    ", "generated_text": "Report on Frankenstein:\n    When reviewing the cultural inpact of Frankenstein it is clear that \n    \n      1.

With \n        the coming of the Victor Frankenstein\u2019s life his work, although \n             created under the new conditions, can be viewed as more creative; one\n        wonders however exactly how that new life can be more creative than this \n        work which was only \u201cinventing for the future\u201d. \n    If this is an accurate portrayal of his life the question of how the novel is \n             an art work is not answered. \n\n \n \n    It could be argued that  Frankenstein has been viewed in several ways in history. \n    As a work of political theory by Karl Marx which describes his theory of socialism as \n             \"The state of humanity must be founded on the principle that it be \n        governed by the will of the people.\" A discussion between Marx and Frederick Nietzsche could add further \n             to the cultural impact of Frankenstein. \n    It could be seen as a scientific text where Charles Darwin was a primary influence over the \n             characters of the novel. A further discussion on the impact of Charles Darnay\u2019s ideas in \n             light of those of Darwin would provide the reader further insight into the cultural and philosophical \n             meanings for Frankenstein. \n    It could be viewed as a medical text or guide book to medical education written by Thomas H. \n             Osler. To add to the meaning of Frankenstein, Frankenstein's work cannot be viewed solely as a \n             medical school text as the novel discusses various aspects of the human being that are also pertinent \n             to health and to the body's role in both physical and mental health. \n    Finally it could be viewed as a study of evolution by Charles Lyell which \n             provides a more complete interpretation of the evolution of the human \n        species where the theme of the monster was seen as a metaphor for \n        mankind. \n \n    The issue of cultural impact is one that needs to be looked at using a \n    multi-pronged approach as there is very little consensus on how Frankenstein \n                     should be interpreted. In examining Frankenstein as a work of art one can ask the question \n             as to whether it is more creative than the original tale of Frankenstein, this is the crux of \n             the issues discussed above and has to be looked at in terms of the overall cultural impact of the \n             novel. A cultural inactivity is to be expected for a book that is \n             not as well known and has been a topic that has never been examined fully so it will be valuable \n             for readers of the novel to undertake a review of the cultural impact of Frankenstein. It would also \n             be useful for a historical and psychological analysis of Frankenstein to be written as it can help \n             elucidate why someone as creative as H. P. Lovecraft might have chosen to use this work as his \n             source for his Cthulhu mythos.        \n \n \n\n- From my point of view the issue of the impact of the novel on society has not been \n      looked at", "temperature": 1}]}
